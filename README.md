MoodMarathon is an ephimeral web application that gamifies mental health maintenance by encouraging users to log in daily and complete various mental health challenges, such as deep breathing or journaling. Users must complete these challenges within a 24-hour window to maintain their streak. Failing to perform the daily challenge within this timeframe results in the loss of their streak.
